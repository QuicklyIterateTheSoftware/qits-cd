/**
 * The deployment posture after the gate flips: {@code qits.auth.machine.required=true}. Everything
 * else here exists to make that posture testable without a qits-idp.
 *
 * <p><b>The verification key is inlined instead of fetched.</b> {@code quarkus.oidc.public-key} puts
 * the extension into local verification, and {@code auth-server-url} is cleared beside it — the key
 * alone is not enough, because a tenant that still has a server URL tries to reach it on the first
 * bearer and answers 500 when it cannot. Clearing the URL also drops the issuer that came with it,
 * so {@code token.issuer} is stated explicitly and {@code iss} stays checked. Everything else — the
 * signature, and {@code aud=qits-cd} from application.properties — is the shipped configuration,
 * checked by the real extension exactly as it will be against the real idp.
 *
 * <p><b>The dev user is switched off</b>, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Under
 * {@code %test} qits-auth-core ships {@code qits.auth.forward.dev-user=dev}, so forward-auth
 * authenticates every request and a bearer would never reach the token mechanism. Empty reads back
 * as absent, which is the mechanism's "no synthetic identity" state — the same state a production
 * build is always in.
